=head1 ACTIVITY

I<memento activity> is a configurable tool which will help you keeping track of
your activities progression and the time spent on it. If you want you can
configure it so that you can use it in conjunction with an issue tracker and a
time tracker.

I<memento activity> provides the following operations:

=over 2

=item I<config>

Manages Memento Activity configurations providing the following operations:

=over 2

=item I<init [--project]>

Initialize your Activity configurations that will be used for defining which
issue tracker and / or time tracker will be used.

=item I<list>

Lists all Memento Activity configurations.

=item I<delete>

=back

=item I<start [issue-id] [--issue-tracker] [--time-tracker] [--manual]>

Starts a new activity. Use B<--manual> option if you don't need to use an Issue
Tracker. If during the configuration operation, the Issue Tracker support was
enabled, you will be asked to insert an Issue Id, or you
can provide it inline I<memento activity start [issue-id]>. It will be
used to extract the activity name from the issue and to change the its status.
Via the I<workflow> tool, it's possible to create a rule for updating issue
status and done ratio on activity start, automatically assigning it to current
user, and optionally add a comment.

=item I<stop>

Use this command when you've to stop working on your activity.
Via the I<workflow> tool, it's possible to create a rule for updating issue
status and done ratio on activity stop and optionally add a comment.

=item I<resume>

If you have previously stopped your activity, you can always resume it by using
this command.

=item I<current [--open]>

You can view what's your current activity by using this command.
If you wanna open it in your browser, then use the --open option.

=back



=head1 BITBUCKET

Due to its API limitations, Bitbucket issue tracker can only be used for branch
naming generation. No change issue status or assignee neither comments creation
operations can be done.

You can easily integrate Memento with multiple instances of Bitbucket, with the
I<memento bitbucket config add> command, and switch from one to another simply
by using the I<memento bitbucket config switch [bitbucket_api_id]> command.

I<memento bitbucket> provides the following operations:

=over 2

=item I<config>

Manages Bitbucket API configurations providing the following options:

=over 2

=item I<add>

Adds a new configurations set for a Bitbucket instance.

=item I<delete [bitbucket_api_id]>

Deletes a configurations set for a Bitbucket instance.

=item I<list>

Lists all Bitbucket configurations.

=item I<switch [bitbucket_api_id]>

Sets a Bitbucket instance as the default one. All queries will be executed to the
default one. Otherwise, you can change on the fly the active Bitbucket instance by
using the B<--api-id> option, for each memento bitbucket command.

=back

=item I<issue [bitbucket_issue_id [--open]]>

Shows the details of an issue. If the B<--open> boolean option has been provided,
the issue will not be rendered, but opened into your default web browser.

=item I<projects>

C<< memento features export all > memento_all.cfg >>

=item I<import [--file]>

Import your features using a previously exported config file. You can choose to
import all of them or just one by one. Use B<--file> option to specify the file
path (in direct input mode), otherwise memento will remember you to specify it
later (progressive input mode):

C<< memento features import git --file memento_all.cfg >>

=back



=head1 GIT

I<memento git> is a configurable tool with the main purpose to help developers
creating branches, following git-flow-like (but divergent) flows. This is not a
wrapper around git core features, but just something like an extension.

I<memento git> provides the following operations:

=over 2

=item I<config>

option to override the default one. If during the configuration operation, the
Issue Tracker support was enabled, you will be asked to insert an Issue Id, or you
can provide it inline I<memento git start [issue-id]>. It will be
used to build the new branch, following the configured branch pattern.
Via the I<workflow> tool, is possible to create a rule for updating issue status
and done ratio on git flow start, automatically assigning it to current user, and
optionally add a comment.

=item I<finish [--safe] [--silent]>

Use this command to merge current branch into the configure B<destination> branch.
Current branch will also be deleted if the B<delete> configuration has been set.
If you are not familiar with this command, use the B<--safe> option to avoid
unwanted behaviors (you will be asked to confirm destination and deletion options).
Via the I<workflow> tool, is possible to create a rule for updating issue status
and done ratio on git flow finish and optionally add a comment.
If you want to avoid execution of B<git flow finish> events, run this command with
the B<--silent> option. Your code will be merged into the destination branch but
no other action will be performed (eg: time traker or issue traker actions).

=item I<pause>
