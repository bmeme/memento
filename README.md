DESCRIPTION

    memento is a modular step by step command line tool. By default it
    provides the following commands:

      - activity
      - bitbucket
      - features
      - git
      - gitlab

    Memento, for each command, provides by default a fallback helper if a
    required argument is missing. For example you can get your last
    executed command via direct input:

ACTIVITY

    memento activity is a configurable tool which will help you keeping
    track of your activities progression and the time spent on it. If you
    want you can configure it so that you can use it in conjunction with an
    issue tracker and a time tracker.

    memento activity provides the following operations:

    config

      Manages Memento Activity configurations providing the following
      operations:

      init [--project]

	Initialize your Activity configurations that will be used for
	defining which issue tracker and / or time tracker will be used.

      list

	Lists all Memento Activity configurations.

      delete

	Delete all Memento Activity configurations.

    start [issue-id] [--issue-tracker] [--time-tracker] [--manual]

      Starts a new activity. Use --manual option if you don't need to use
      an Issue Tracker. If during the configuration operation, the Issue
      Tracker support was enabled, you will be asked to insert an Issue Id,
      or you can provide it inline memento activity start [issue-id]. It
      will be used to extract the activity name from the issue and to
      change the its status. Via the workflow tool, it's possible to create
      a rule for updating issue status and done ratio on activity start,
      automatically assigning it to current user, and optionally add a
      comment.

    stop

      Use this command when you've to stop working on your activity. Via
      the workflow tool, it's possible to create a rule for updating issue
      status and done ratio on activity stop and optionally add a comment.

    resume

      If you have previously stopped your activity, you can always resume
      it by using this command.

    current [--open]

      You can view what's your current activity by using this command. If
      you wanna open it in your browser, then use the --open option.

BITBUCKET

    Due to its API limitations, Bitbucket issue tracker can only be used
    for branch naming generation. No change issue status or assignee
    neither comments creation operations can be done.

    You can easily integrate Memento with multiple instances of Bitbucket,
    with the memento bitbucket config add command, and switch from one to
    another simply by using the memento bitbucket config switch
    [bitbucket_api_id] command.

    memento bitbucket provides the following operations:

    config

      Manages Bitbucket API configurations providing the following options:

      add

	Adds a new configurations set for a Bitbucket instance.

      delete [bitbucket_api_id]

	Deletes a configurations set for a Bitbucket instance.

      list

	Lists all Bitbucket configurations.

      switch [bitbucket_api_id]

	Sets a Bitbucket instance as the default one. All queries will be
	executed to the default one. Otherwise, you can change on the fly
	the active Bitbucket instance by using the --api-id option, for
	each memento bitbucket command.

    issue [bitbucket_issue_id [--open]]

      Shows the details of an issue. If the --open boolean option has been
      provided, the issue will not be rendered, but opened into your
      default web browser.

    projects

      Renders a table containing info about all available Bitbucket
      projects.

    user

      Renders a table containing info about current user referring to the
      active api.

FEATURES

    memento features allows you to export and import all your tools
    configurations.

    It provides the following operations:

    export

      Export configurations of your tools (features). You can choose to
      export all of them or just one by one. By default the export will be
      printed to the standard output. If you want you can save your
      configurations into a file by using ">" as follows:

      memento features export all > memento_all.cfg

    import [--file]

      Import your features using a previously exported config file. You can
      choose to import all of them or just one by one. Use --file option to
      specify the file path (in direct input mode), otherwise memento will
      remember you to specify it later (progressive input mode):

      memento features import git --file memento_all.cfg

GIT

    memento git is a configurable tool with the main purpose to help
    developers creating branches, following git-flow-like (but divergent)
    flows. This is not a wrapper around git core features, but just
    something like an extension.

    memento git provides the following operations:

    config

      Manages Memento Git configurations providing the following
      operations:

      init [--project]

	Initialize your git repository storing configurations that will be
	used for branches creation, project name configuration and git
	hooks management. Use --project option to specify a project name.

      list

	Lists all Memento Git configurations.

      delete

	Delete all Memento Git configurations affecting your current
	repository.

    root

      Utility command used to show the repository root.

    start [issue-id] [--source]

      Creates a new branch starting from the configured source branch. Use
      --source option to override the default one. If during the
      configuration operation, the Issue Tracker support was enabled, you
      will be asked to insert an Issue Id, or you can provide it inline
      memento git start [issue-id]. It will be used to build the new
      branch, following the configured branch pattern. Via the workflow
      tool, is possible to create a rule for updating issue status and done
      ratio on git flow start, automatically assigning it to current user,
      and optionally add a comment.

    finish [--safe] [--silent]

      Use this command to merge current branch into the configure
      destination branch. Current branch will also be deleted if the delete
      configuration has been set. If you are not familiar with this
      command, use the --safe option to avoid unwanted behaviors (you will
      be asked to confirm destination and deletion options). Via the
      workflow tool, is possible to create a rule for updating issue status
      and done ratio on git flow finish and optionally add a comment. If
      you want to avoid execution of git flow finish events, run this
      command with the --silent option. Your code will be merged into the
      destination branch but no other action will be performed (eg: time
      traker or issue traker actions).

    pause

      If you have enabled a Time Tracker, use this command to pause the
      timer and log your worked hours. This will not affect your code but
      will only handle time entries.

    resume

      If you have previously paused your Time Tracker, you can always
      resume it by using this command.

    log

      Show the git log tree in a pretty format.

    rebase

      memento git rebase

      Rebases current branch with the configured source branch.

      memento git rebase <branch_name>

      Rebases current branch with the provided one.
