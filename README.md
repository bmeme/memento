SYNOPSIS
    memento [-OPTIONS [-MORE_OPTIONS]] [--] [PROGRAM_ARG1 ...]

    The following single-character options are accepted: Boolean (without
    arguments): --version --help

DESCRIPTION
    memento is a modular step by step command line tool. By default it
    provides the following commands:

      - bitbucket
      - features
      - git
      - gitlab
      - history
      - jira
      - paymo
      - redmine
      - schema
      - workflow

    Memento, for each command, provides by default a fallback helper if a
    required argument is missing. For example you can get your last executed
    command via direct input:

      $ memento history last
      memento git status

    or via progressive input:

      $ memento
      Enter the tool name to be used:
      - bitbucket
      - features
      - git
      - gitlab
      - history
      - jira
      - redmine
      - schema
      - workflow
      » history

      Choose a command:
      - bookmark
      - bookmarks
      - clear
      - exec
      - last
      - list
      - unbookmark
      » last

      memento git status

    If you want to extend Memento with your own tools, put them into
    Memento/Tool/custom directory. The best tools will be added into Memento
    core tools, so feel free to send us your tool!

INSTALLATION
    In order to be able to manage third party perl modules Memento requires
    cpan (http://www.cpan.org/).

    Open a terminal and execute the install.pl file located into memento
    dir:

    `./install.pl'

    *On Ubuntu*
      Before install Memento, be sure to have *perl-doc* and
      *libwww-curl-perl*:

      `sudo apt-get install perl-doc'

      `sudo apt-get install libwww-curl-perl'

      `sudo ./install.pl'
      
      *On Debian (9.1 - stretch)*
       Before install Memento, be sure to have *libssl-dev* and *zlib1g-dev*:
       
       `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev zlib1g-dev`
       
       `./install.pl`
       
       The script will ask you for the sudo password when needed.
       
BITBUCKET
    Due to its API limitations, Bitbucket issue tracker can only be used for
    branch naming generation. No change issue status or assignee neither
    comments creation operations can be done.

    You can easily integrate Memento with multiple instances of Bitbucket,
    with the *memento bitbucket config add* command, and switch from one to
    another simply by using the *memento bitbucket config switch
    [bitbucket_api_id]* command.

    *memento bitbucket* provides the following operations:

    *config*
      Manages Bitbucket API configurations providing the following options:

      *add*
        Adds a new configurations set for a Bitbucket instance.

      *delete [bitbucket_api_id]*
        Deletes a configurations set for a Bitbucket instance.

      *list*
        Lists all Bitbucket configurations.

      *switch [bitbucket_api_id]*
        Sets a Bitbucket instance as the default one. All queries will be
        executed to the default one. Otherwise, you can change on the fly
        the active Bitbucket instance by using the --api-id option, for each
        memento bitbucket command.

    *issue [bitbucket_issue_id [--open]]*
      Shows the details of an issue. If the --open boolean option has been
      provided, the issue will not be rendered, but opened into your default
      web browser.

    *projects*
      Renders a table containing info about all available Bitbucket
      projects.

    *user*
      Renders a table containing info about current user referring to the
      active api.

FEATURES
    *memento features* allows you to export and import all your tools
    configurations.

    It provides the following operations:

    *export*
      Export configurations of your tools (features). You can choose to
      export all of them or just one by one. By default the export will be
      printed to the standard output. If you want you can save your
      configurations into a file by using ">" as follows:

      `memento features export all > memento_all.cfg'

    *import [--file]*
      Import your features using a previously exported config file. You can
      choose to import all of them or just one by one. Use --file option to
      specify the file path (in direct input mode), otherwise memento will
      remember you to specify it later (progressive input mode):

      `memento features import git --file memento_all.cfg'

GIT
    *memento git* is a configurable tool with the main purpose to help
    developers creating branches, following git-flow-like (but divergent)
    flows. This is not a wrapper around git core features, but just
    something like an extension.

    *memento git* provides the following operations:

    *config*
      Manages Memento Git configurations providing the following operations:

      *init [--project]*
        Initialize your git repository storing configurations that will be
        used for branches creation, project name configuration and git hooks
        management. Use --project option to specify a project name.

      *list*
        Lists all Memento Git configurations.

      *delete*
        Delete all Memento Git configurations affecting your current
        repository.

    *root*
      Utility command used to show the repository root.

    *start [--source]*
      Creates a new branch starting from the configured source branch. Use
      --source option to override the default one. If during the
      configuration operation, the Issue Tracker support was enabled, you
      will be asked to insert an Issue Id. It will be used to build the new
      branch, following the configured branch pattern. Via the *workflow*
      tool, is possible to create a rule for updating issue status and done
      ratio on git flow start, automatically assigning it to current user,
      and optionally add a comment.

    *finish [--safe] [--silent]*
      Use this command to merge current branch into the configure
      destination branch. Current branch will also be deleted if the delete
      configuration has been set. If you are not familiar with this command,
      use the --safe option to avoid unwanted behaviors (you will be asked
      to confirm destination and deletion options). Via the *workflow* tool,
      is possible to create a rule for updating issue status and done ratio
      on git flow finish and optionally add a comment. If you want to avoid
      execution of git flow finish events, run this command with the
      --silent option. Your code will be merged into the destination branch
      but no other action will be performed (eg: time traker or issue traker
      actions).

    *pause*
      If you have enabled a Time Tracker, use this command to pause the
      timer and log your worked hours. This will not affect your code but
      will only handle time entries.

    *resume*
      If you have previously paused your Time Tracker, you can always resume
      it by using this command.

    *log*
      Show the git log tree in a pretty format.

    You can easily integrate Memento with multiple instances of Gitlab, with
    the *memento gitlab config add* command, and switch from one to another
